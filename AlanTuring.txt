Alan Turing was born on June 13th 1912 in London. Then in 1938 He went to Princeton University to study cryptography and got a Ph.D. in mathematics. A year later he went to a code breaking organization for Britain. During WWII he devoted himself to cracking the German's enigma machine to give the allied powers a advantage in the war. He eventually was able to find a way to decrypt the enigma machine, and the later the Lorenz machine. He eventually died on June 8th 1954, by presumed suicide via cyanide. https://www.history.com/articles/alan-turing
